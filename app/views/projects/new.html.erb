<h1>New Project</h1>
<!--While creating this partial, you should also change all instances of @project to be project
Why have we done this variable renaming? Because to be reusable, partial views shouldn’t rely on
instance variables - they should be totally self-sufficient. When we render the partial from our main
view, we can pass in the data that the partial needs to render - in this case, we’ll pass in the @project
variable, which means it will be accessible as a local variable from within the partial-->
<% if project.errors.any? %>
    <div id="error_explanation">
      <h2><%= pluralize(project.errors.count, "error")%>
      prohibited this project from being saved:</h2>
      <ul>
        <% project.errors.full_messages.each do |msg| %>
            <li><%= msg %></li>
        <% end %>
      </ul>
    </div>
<% end %>

<!-- passing into project key, an instance variable @project the partial form can read! -->
<%= render "form", project: @project %>
