    <!--While creating this partial, you should also change all instances of @project to be project
Why have we done this variable renaming? Because to be reusable, partial views shouldn’t rely on
instance variables - they should be totally self-sufficient. When we render the partial from our main
view, we can pass in the data that the partial needs to render - in this case, we’ll pass in the @project
variable, which means it will be accessible as a local variable from within the partial-->
<%= simple_form_for(project) do |f| %>
      <%= f.input :name %>
      <%= f.input :description %>

    <%= f.button :submit, class: "btn-primary" %>
